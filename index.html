            We address the challenge of theoretically grounded feature recovery using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) for interpreting Large Language Models. Current SAE training methods lack mathematical guarantees and face issues like hyperparameter sensitivity. We propose a statistical framework for feature recovery that models polysemantic features as sparse mixtures of monosemantic concepts. Based on this, we develop a "bias adaptation" SAE training algorithm that dynamically adjusts network biases for optimal sparsity. We <span class="highlight">prove that this algorithm correctly recovers all monosemantic features</span> under our statistical model. Our improved variant, Group Bias Adaptation (GBA), <span class="highlight">outperforms existing methods on LLMs up to 1.5 billion parameters</span> in terms of sparsity-loss trade-off and feature consistency. This work provides the first SAE algorithm with theoretical recovery guarantees, advancing interpretable and trustworthy AI through enhanced mechanistic understanding.

            <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">WHAT IS FEATURE RECOVERY?</h2>
            To understand the task of feature recovery, let us consider the following example sentence: 
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    <i>The detective found a <span style="background-color: rgba(255,255,0,0.25); color: black; font-weight: bold;">muddy footprint</span> near the <span style="background-color: rgba(0,128,128,0.10); color: black; font-weight: bold;">broken window</span>, leading him to suspect a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">?</span></i>
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            The sentence contains two distinct concepts: a muddy footprint and a broken window. For a trained deep neural network, the learned representations in the intermediate layers are often <span class="highlight">polysemantic</span>, meaning that they are mixture of multiple features of the underlying concepts.
            Specifically, the representation \(x\) after seeing the whole sentence may have the following form:
            <blockquote style="text-align: center;">
                \(x = h_1 \cdot\) <span class="term">
                    <span style="background-color: rgba(255,255,0,0.25);">
                        <b><i>"feature of muddy footprint"</i></b>
                    </span>
                </span>
                \( + h_2 \cdot\) <span class="term">
                    <span style="background-color: rgba(0,128,128,0.10);">
                        <b><i>"feature of broken window"</i></b>
                    </span>
                </span>
            </blockquote>
            where \(h_1\) and \(h_2\) are the nonnegative weights of the two <span class="highlight">monosemantic features</span>. After obtaining the polysemantic representation \(x\), the model can then generate the token "burglary" at the "?" position.<br>
            <blockquote>
              <b>The goal of feature recovery</b> is to recover the <span class="highlight">monosemantic features</span> underlying each concept, through training on a dataset that contains <span class="highlight">polysemantic representations</span>, which are often extracted from the intermediate layers of a trained deep neural network, e.g., the residual stream of a transformer-based model.
            </blockquote>
            While this example illustrates the intuitive notion of monosemantic features, we need a more rigorous definition to make progress. 
            Currently, researchers primarily assess monosemanticity through feature <i>interpretability</i>, i.e., how well a feature aligns with human-understandable concepts.
            However, this anthropocentric view has limitations: neural networks may process information in ways fundamentally different from human conceptual understanding. We need a more principled, mathematically grounded definition of monosemantic features that captures their essential properties independent of human interpretation. Specifically, we ask the following questions:

            <h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">WHAT ARE SPARSE AUTOENCODERS?</h2>
            At the core of our feature recovery method is the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), a neural network designed to learn sparse representations through self-reconstruction. A typical SAE architecture (with weight sharing between encoding and decoding layers) can be described as follows:
            \[
                f(x; \Theta) = \sum_{m=1}^M a_{m} \cdot w_{m} \cdot \phi\bigl( \underbrace{{w_{m}^\top (x-b_{\mathrm{pre}}) + b_{m}}}_{\displaystyle  \small\text{pre-activation}~y_m} \bigr) + b_{\mathrm{pre}}.
            \]

            A neuron is considered "activated" when its pre-activation y_m > 0. When activated, the neuron contributes to the output proportionally to its weight vector w_m, scaled by a_m.
            <ul>
                <li>
                🔍 <b>What are SAEs?</b> Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are neural networks that are used to "decompose" the inner representation of another neural network (e.g., LLM) into a set of monosemantic features.
                </li>
                <li>
                  🔧<b>How are SAEs trained?</b> SAEs are trained to reconstruct intermediate representations of LLMs while ensuring that each input activates only a small number of neurons in the learned representation.
                </li>
                <li>
                🤔 <b>Why using SAEs?</b> The hypothesis is that by enforcing activation sparsity, SAEs can decompose polysemantic representations (a mixture of multiple features) into monosemantic features (which each correspond to a single interpretable concept).
                </li>
                <!-- <li> -->
                <!-- 🎯 <b>The key challenge</b> is designing training algorithms that reliably recover these monosemantic features while maintaining good reconstruction quality.

        <h2 class="title is-3">Algorithm Motivation</h2>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            To address the limitations of existing Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) training methods, we propose a new algorithm called <span class="highlight-2">Grouped Bias Adaptation (GBA)</span>. 
            Our algorithm has two main components: a <b>bias adaptation</b> subroutine that controls the activation frequency of each neuron, and a <b>neuron grouping</b> strategy that allows us to assign different target activation frequencies to different groups of neurons. 
          </p>
          <!-- <ol> -->
            <!-- <li><strong>Bias Adaptation</strong><br>
              Each neuron has a bias value that helps control when it activates. We adjust the bias dynamically based on the frequency of activation over a dataset. If a neuron is activated too frequently, we decrease its bias to reduce its activation. On the other hand, if it's rarely activated, we increase its bias to encourage more frequent activations. This helps maintain a balance between sufficient activation and avoiding "dead" neurons that don't contribute effectively.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Neuron Grouping</strong><br>
              Instead of applying the same activation frequency control to all neurons, we group neurons into distinct sets. Each group targets different activation frequencies, allowing us to better capture both common and rare features in the data. For example, neurons that capture frequently occurring features might have a higher target activation frequency, while those that capture rarer features might have a lower one.
            </li> -->
          <!-- </ol> -->
          <!-- <p>
            By combining these two strategies, GBA offers direct control over neuron activation, avoiding the need for complex tuning while ensuring that neurons are activated at appropriate frequencies for their tasks.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            In this section, we evaluate the performance of our Grouped Bias Adaptation (GBA) algorithm across several key dimensions. To ensure a comprehensive understanding, we first briefly introduce the experimental setup before diving into the analysis of the three key questions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Experiment Setup Section -->
        <h3 class="title is-4">Experimental Setup</h3>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            We conduct our experiments using two datasets: <code>Pile Github</code> and <code>Pile Wikipedia</code> datasets, each with the first 100k tokens. The experiments are performed on the <span class="highlight">Qwen2.5-1.5B base model</span>, where we attach a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to the MLP outputs of layers 2, 13, and 26. Each SAE contains <span class="highlight">66k hidden neurons</span> and operates with an input/output dimension of <span class="highlight">1536</span>.

            To ensure optimal performance, we adopt the JumpReLU activation function for all methods tested. We use <span class="highlight">100 million tokens</span> for training the SAEs, feeding the tokens through the LLM and collecting the MLP outputs at the specified layers.

            The four methods compared are:
            <ul>
              <li><code>TopK</code>: A sparse activation method that retains only the top-K activated neurons.</li>
              <li><code>L1</code>: A sparse method that uses L1 regularization for sparsity.</li>
              <li><code>BA (Bias Adaptation)</code>: A variant of GBA with a single group and hyperparameter tuning for sparsity.</li>
              <li><code>GBA (Grouped Bias Adaptation)</code>: Our proposed method, which uses multiple groups of neurons with target activation frequencies (TAFs) set geometrically without hyperparameter tuning.</li>
            </ul>
            All methods were trained using the AdamW optimizer with the same set of hyperparameters, including learning rate, weight decay, and batch size. In the GBA method, we used <span class="highlight">10 groups</span>, with the highest target frequency set to <span class="highlight">0.1</span> and the lowest set to <span class="highlight">0.001</span>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="title is-4">Reconstruction Loss and Activation Sparsity Frontier</h3>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            The first question we address is how the GBA method compares with other methods in terms of reconstruction loss and activation sparsity. The results show that GBA performs comparably to the TopK method with post-activation sparsity and outperforms it with pre-activation sparsity. Furthermore, GBA significantly outperforms the L1 and Bias Adaptation (BA) methods across all experiments.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding (1):</strong> GBA performs <span class="highlight">comparably to the best-performing benchmark</span>, <span class="highlight">TopK</span> with post-activation sparsity. In addition, GBA outperforms TopK with pre-activation sparsity. Specifically, when these methods have the same average fraction of activated neurons, GBA's reconstruction is comparable to that of TopK with post-activation sparsity and significantly better than that of TopK with pre-activation sparsity.</li>
            <li><strong>Finding (2):</strong> <span class="highlight">GBA outperforms L1</span> significantly. When they have the same average fraction of activated neurons, GBA achieves a lower reconstruction loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Finding (3):</strong> <span class="highlight">GBA outperforms BA</span> consistently across all experiments. This provides strong evidence that the grouping mechanism enhances both sparsity and reconstruction performance.</li>

        <h3 class="title is-4">Robustness and Nearly Tuning-Free</h3>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            The second question revolves around the robustness of the GBA method to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the number of groups and target frequencies. Our ablation studies show that GBA is nearly tuning-free. As long as the Highest Target Frequency (HTF) is sufficiently high (e.g., 0.5) and the number of groups (K) is large enough (e.g., 10 or 20), GBA performs consistently well.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding (4):</strong> When HTF and LTF are properly chosen (e.g., a high HTF and a modestly low LTF), with an adequate number of groups, the GBA method achieves performance comparable to TopK, and the performance becomes largely <span class="highlight">insensitive to the specific choices of these parameters</span>.</li>
          </ul>
          <!-- <p>
            Even with variations in LTF and the number of groups, GBA maintains stable performance, making it less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning compared to methods like TopK, which requires manual tuning of the number of activated neurons.

            The third question examines the consistency of the features learned by the GBA method across independent runs with different random seeds. We evaluate this using the Maximum Cosine Similarity (MCS) metric, and the results show that GBA outperforms other methods, including TopK, in terms of feature consistency. The specific definition of MCS can be found in the §A.2 of the paper. Simply put, MCS represents the similarity between the ground truth feature and the learned feature, with higher values indicating better consistency.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Finding (5):</strong> As the TopK method is shown to be seed-dependent, it has the lowest MCS overall. Our <span class="highlight">GBA method outperforms TopK</span> in achieving a higher percentage of neurons with high MCS.</li>
            <li><strong>Finding (6):</strong> The L1 method is more consistent than TopK uniformly and more consistent than GBA in three of the four cases. However, when focusing on neurons with the top-0.05% activations, our GBA method surpasses the L1 method.</li>

          <p>
            We provide additional studies on the neurons learned by the GBA and TopK methods in terms of the three metrics used above: maximum activation, Z-score, and maximum cosine similarity across different runs with different random seeds.
            These metrics are computed based on the validation part of the <code>Github</code> dataset, with the hook position at the MLP output of layer 26.
            For each neuron, we also compute the <em>activation fraction</em> (or activation rate), which is the fraction of tokens where the pre-activations of the neuron are non-negative.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each neuron, we have four metrics: maximum activation, Z-score, maximum cosine similarity, and activation fraction. We generate scatter plots by plotting the Z-score against the other three metrics. The results for GBA and TopK are shown below.
